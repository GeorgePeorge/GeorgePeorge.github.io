Finally got a nice snazzy theme going on, it's called Pixyll. Decided on this one due to the focus on content, as I'm not one to like a complex OTT site.

Git was giving me a headache setting up this new site, and I was trying to just update the old one, but had no luck and ended up starting over. Learnt how to 'fork' now at least.

Knowing me I will end up changing the theme again soon enough.
