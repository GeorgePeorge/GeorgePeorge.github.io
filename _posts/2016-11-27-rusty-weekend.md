A very unproductive weekend, haven't really done any programming whatsoever. Did read up about some of the new stuff HTML5 can do, as I haven't fully explored what it can be used for apart from a sparse few features.

Visit to Manchester was very enjoyable so that's something good to bring from this weekend. Tomorrow in work I'm going to finally try to finish the layout for the publications page I've been given to do, and also remember to do some ENA grants because I haven't done any for a while and Jim wants to get through them.
