This week's main issue I've been trying to fix is a vanishing corner, I have a table that is being created in HTML and is populated by links and a title. The 'table' contains only one cell and is essentially being used as a border, I may need to change it to actually just use a border because for some reason since I've changed the layout of the page a little bit the top-right corner of the box has vanished and won't return no matter what I do the the content within or surrounding the box.

CSS is a crazy crazy thing.
