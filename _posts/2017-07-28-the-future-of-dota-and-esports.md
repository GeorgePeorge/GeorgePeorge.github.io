**eSports is like an inevitability at this point, much to the dismay of parents and the old fashioned alike**

It's prevalence is becoming noticeable to everyone, as more and more people find a game they can watch and enjoy. Many sports websites, including giants like ESPN, now have an eSports section and dedicated eSports journalists. Just today the **_BBC_** announced that they would be showing eSports, not a sentence I thought I would get to say as a Brit.

In this write-up I thought I'd take a look at DotA in particular and how it's progressed through the eSports scene and the path that's set for its future.

# Where can we go next?

The main conundrum now facing eSports is how to grow as a whole. The two MOBAs, DotA and League of Legends, are the giants of the scene currently and run events entirely on their own. Many other lesser eSports are featured at tournaments such as GFinity where they all lumped into a large group of completely varied games, from fighting games like Tekken to sports games like Rocket League.

_How does eSports grow when it's so hard for people to start watching?_ A question that is frequently asked. Even casual gamers, let alone non-gamers would watch DotA with little to no idea how to process the vast amount of information being thrown at them. DotA is a vastly deep and complex game, and even on a high level can be difficult to understand with 112 unique playable heroes; how do people who don't even understand the game enjoy watching these amazing players show off their unbelievable skill? If we take Football (or Soccer) as an example, it's beauty is that it's brilliantly simple to understand and just as easy to recognize skill disparity between different players. _Messi is clearly better than Rooney at football, I'm not a fan and I know that._

People new to watching DotA aren't going to appreciate when the Earth Spirit lands a brilliant boulder smash onto all 5 of the enemy heroes, or appreciate the micro skills required to play heroes such as Meepo or Arc Warden. As a keen watcher, I love watching pros pull things off on heroes I didn't even think were possible.

How do we get new people invested in DotA? *_We get them playing_*

# DotA's stagnating playerbase

It's not secret now that DotA as a game is not growing, but bizarrely it's not shrinking (much) either. DotA is clearly in the position of having an extremely loyal (or addicted, depending on how you look at it) playerbase, and suffering from a lack of draw for new players. Valve have very recently started working on their new player experience
