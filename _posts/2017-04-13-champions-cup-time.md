We qualified for the Champions Cup.

After successively failing to even get passed the quarter finals of the Battle Cup in tier 6 week in, week out: we somehow won one after dropping down to tier 5. And it was unexpectedly easy.

Although it's a totally unrealistic proposal, it's funny to think winning two more weekends in a row could see us getting a qualifying spot for the International and playing against some of the best teams in the world that's I've followed and watched for years in a packed out stadium. But then I remember that on the 22nd we will be competing against possibly tier 7 Battle Cup champions, some of whom will probably be legitimate pro players or retired pros and it's a little less fun of an idea.

Really enjoyed watching the DAC, great to see IG along with BurNing pick up a win, showing that the DotA veterans still got it. They were really impressive in a 3-0 sweep of OG who were looking extremely dominant. Certainly makes things interesting for this next major, personally I would love to see Liquid get going as a team after an *very* disappointing showing at DAC as they have some of my favourite players. I'm predicting OG to take it though, cementing themselves as still the most consistently strong team in DotA right now, once they've worked out how not to play with their illusions hero strats.

7.05 brought some interesting changes, especially from my perspective as an offlaner. Tranquil boots nerf makes my life more difficult, especially combined with the nerf to shrines, which I didn't think I'd notice the difference in but has been significant for me already, particularly on heroes with little sustain. Intrigued to see whether Magnus and Lina will keep their spots in nearly every pick/ban at Kiev, along with the ever present Monkey King who's sure to be nerfed again soon as his ultimate provides to strong a platform for teamfighting.


Favourite hero this week: Earth Spirit

Been *spamming* this guy since learning his combos and stuff, he's awesome. So impactful, so fun and prevents people picking jungle Legion in my games since I like to roam with him. T H E D R E A M
