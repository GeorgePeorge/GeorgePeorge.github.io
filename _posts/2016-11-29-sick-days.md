Been off ill the last couple of days so relatively low on the productivity scale. Have gotten round to building a bit of a site for a friend, who also wants to run a blog, but has no clue how to host/set it up, so that's something at least. Definitely gonna be back in work tomorrow, today was more of a cautionary decision to have it off, due to illness spreading like wildfire in the office whenever someone comes in ill.

Hopefully be able to return feeling extremely rejuvenated and productive. Hopefully..

Feeling christmassy and cheerful too, which is always great.
