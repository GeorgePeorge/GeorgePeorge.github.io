<strong>Preface</strong>

I am a huge Pokémon fan, particularly of the first generation. Although I have enjoyed basically every installment of the Pokémon series I am always cynical of the new Pokémon themselves (Vanilluxe, cmon) so that is one of the reasons I was pleasantly surprised by the newest installment in the beloved series.


<strong>The First Hour</strong>

I didn't read up much on this game and went in relatively blind, which is usually the best way to play Pokémon as it gives it that more adventuring feel the Pokémon games have been giving children and nerds like me for 20 or so years. I had seen the starters on Youtube though, and was quite the fan. I instantly mentally picked Rowlett (The Grass/Flying type) as I liked it's duel typing and there's just something so cute about Owls to me.

The game opens basically with the classic meeting with the Professor of the new region you will be exploring, in this case it's Professor Kukui, who is constantly shirtless. Apart from his borderline blunt Hawaiian stereotype, he is actually probably the least bland and most likable Pokémon Professor we've had. (Sorry Prof Oak)

This is one of the primary things I love about the game so far, Game Freak have done a fantastic job with characterization in this game, they are much more lovable and feel like they have more depth than the usual generic Pokémon stereotypes we get.

We are also introduced to our Mom, who to the horror of many Pokémon fans, has her own room in the house, breaking years of weird and non-sensical tradition. The family Meowth is sent to wake you up, and whilst being slightly annoying, even HE gets some characterization in this game which I really appreciated.

I am skipping over some of the story, partly to avoid spoilers, and partly because it's quite long. One of the things I did read about this game was that it's much more heavily story focused than almost all the previous installations, and this is clear quite early on. It does slow down the pacing of the intro to the game, but it also looks great and feels like I'm working towards something and developing a story which is something I have not felt from a Pokémon game in a considerable while (Throwback to Pokémon Ruby & Sapphire, great games).

After we have picked out starter Pokémon, we are told about the 'Island Challenges' which from what I gather are the replacement for gyms in this game. As to this point, I am yet to take on an Island Challenge and am still relatively in the dark as to what they actually are. I love this feeling.

At this point we are taught (for the 100th time) how to catch Pokémon and then we can finally explore ourselves with the Pokémon we chose! Instantly, it's clear that there are a LOT of Kanto Pokémon in this game, like a LOT. Whilst I am not going to complain about this necessarily as I am huge fan of the original 150, it would be nice to get to know the new Pokémon! Particularly because, for once, I have very little complain about when it comes to the design of the new monsters, they are genuinely generally brilliant. I love the starters, the legendaries and the Alolan forms of older generations of Pokémon are awesome. I just wish we saw more of them!

We are soon shifted off to the trainers school, where we're told we will learn to become a Pokémon trainer. It actually just breaks down to four relatively easy battles and then battling the head of the school, who is also easy enough.

This is basically all I achieved in the first hour, and this highlights a definite issue with the game at first. I am really enjoying the story heavy focus of the game, but it also REALLY slows down the pacing, and makes you feel like you aren't free to explore this new region, which is especially frustrating because Game Freak have gone for such a refreshing take on the series (No gyms etc). Generally though , I am having a blast with the new Pokémon game, and am sure I will continue too.

I'm not going to give a rating because I feel like it's irrelevant in this format. So I will say, if you are a Pokémon fan who wants a great experience with familiar faces but a refreshing take on the beloved series, this is a hell of a good time.
