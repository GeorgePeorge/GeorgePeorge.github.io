As the Boston Major came to a close, we were treated to a video showing a flying view of the DotA updates over the year (Starting from 6.00) and finally ending with it being revealed that the newest update will be 7.00, the first new version since 2005. We were directed to a countdown page, that unveiled itself yesterday (11/12/2016) at 6.00pm in Chinese at first for some reason.

The update is definitely the most significant content and gameplay update I've had since I've been playing DotA 2 (early 2013), as I did not play during the years of the Warcraft mod, DotA. The size of this update is leading to it being titled 'DotA 3', and I don't think I blame people for the hype.

_A quick overview:_

* First new hero (that being a hero that wasn't previously in DotA 1), *Monkey King*
* Remodels on heroes: Viper, Slardar, Enigma
* Talents (At levels 10, 15, 20, 25)
* Big changes to the UI
* Big gameplay changes, including new rune spots; new buildings; hero changes, changes to illusions and many more
* Changes to the map

**Monkey King**

The big talking point of the update is, of course, *Monkey King*. Being the first 'original' hero added into DotA by Valve, he is naturally a big talking point and points to a possibly endless growth of heroes for DotA 2.

I am so so so incredibly excited to give this hero a go. I love heroes that present a different and varying style of play, and especially due to his deceptive playstyle he looks to be a lot of fun.


**Remodels**

Not much to say here other than that they look really great. Sad to see Jakiro isn't getting one as I feel his model is looking really shoddy in comparison to all the other heroes, especially the newly remodeled or released ones.

(I honestly don't see that much difference with Enigma except for he hit the gym)

**Talents**

This to me is one of the biggest gameplay changes added. It strays very much from the traditional leveling system of DotA, going as far as changing the XP gain of heroes and the levels at which they can upgrade their ultimates (it's now 6/12/18).

I think it's one of those changes that will only be possible to critique once we get hands on with the new gameplay in this update.

(Hype for no mana Wraith King reincarnation)

**UI**

I love love love the new pregame screen. The planning phase is a fantastic idea, and the background loading of the game is brilliant, considering I myself play with people who will often have trouble loading in sometimes. The pre-buying of starting items and predicting enemy lanes are particularly awesome additions.

The ingame UI looks to be great, very clean, which I appreciate as a self-titled web designer. Smaller map, so no more clicking on the corner of it when you're trying to run away from an angry Legion Commander with Duel up.



I won't talk about the gameplay as I feel my actual skill level isn't high enough to judge the gameplay changes at a reasonable level. I am very excited for some of the new Aghanims upgrades (Pocket Riki) and anime Zeus.
