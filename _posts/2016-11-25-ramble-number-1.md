I have to get on so many trains it's making me anxious just thinking about it. Traveling sucks, and so does the apparent 'free' wifi we get everywhere, I literally cannot connect to the 'free' wifi in this train station via this laptop, what's the point?

Gives me some time to practice my Ruby though, and an opportunity to do some of the more boring things I would never normally get round to doing unless I'm stuck in a train station drinking average coffee, like checking my e-mails, talking to real life people, and writing. About an hour away from when my train arrives, I of course arrived vastly too early just so there was no possible way I could miss it, in case they decided for some reason to leave a whole hour early.

Going to London, Manchester and Sheffield this weekend, I haven't ever been too two of these places so that's kinda exciting. I have so little money because I brought a guitar (oops) that it's gonna be a tight weekend but a fun one for sure.

---EDIT---

I take it all back, the three hour train to Sheffield has no wifi whatsoever. Pray for me.
