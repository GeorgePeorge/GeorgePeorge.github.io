Been ages since I've actually written anything on this blog, after I got annoyed that my last post about DotA 2 wouldn't post for some reason and there is just an empty date left on the page that I can't even remove. Annoying.

Work is going well, was kinda slow for a while because I finished most the pages we needed to get done, but I've recently been updating a publications page that Lesley created and although it took a while, I got it done and she is now able to program it onto the live site hopefully. My next course of action in work is to add a 'google' styled search box to the navigation bar at the top of each page on the website to make a more cohesive user experience site wide. Shouldn't be too difficult.

Personally, been having fun, getting out, enjoying myself. Six Nations was generally terrible as a Welsh fan but at least the Ireland win was convincing, and led to a great night out.
