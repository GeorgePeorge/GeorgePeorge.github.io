The newest DotA 2 patch is here and with it brings the long anticipated Juggernaut arcana that was voted for during TI6 (The International 6). To many peoples dismay (birthing a 'RIGGED' meme) Juggernaut won the vote over Io, a hero that currently has no cosmetics whatsoever, whereas Yurnero The Juggernaut already has a well fleshed out collection available.

I myself was relatively happy Juggernaut won as he is one of my favourite, most played heroes. I am now left with a bitter taste at how disappointing the arcana actually is, and that's not due to a lack of trying. The arcana colour scheme is the primary thing that people are going crazy over on reddit etc and I do agree that it's *insanely* similar looking to Phantom Assassin's arcana when in game, contradicting Valve's own "glance value" ethics when it comes to approving other cosmetics.

My main gripe is simply how much *stuff* has been packed into it, it's just so gratuitous. I mean blah blah moneys worth and all that but most the arcana design just doesn't make any sense to be linked to Juggernaut, and I know DotA has some of the worst lore going, but I at least would like the items to cosmetically be consistent with the design and concept of the hero. Why are Valve so obsessed with making every hero imbued with the spirit of some elder god/weapon/spirit just because you paid Â£30 on them? Be creative.

Rant aside, the 7.03 patch is pretty cool actually. Jakiro looks great, the meta of 5 man deathballing around the map the whole game has been nerfed thanks to the lowering of gold and xp bounties and the changes to tower armor (+2 for each enemy hero nearby within a 1200 radius). My personal favourite is that Captain's Mode doesn't look crap now, and has finally been brought to aesthetically fit in with the rest of DotA Reborn (damn, that was such a long time ago)

Personally, DotA is going terribly, yet to win a single Battle Cup game and no matter what I do I can't raise my MMR, maybe I'm destined to be 2k forever. I hate this game, and yet *love it* all the same
