I am currently a third year student on my Industrial Year working at STFC as a junior web developer. My experience is mainly in HTML5, CSS and Javascript, with a smattering of experience in other languages. Currently learning Ruby to further my skills in web development, starting off with using some RubyGems with Jekyll and stuff to improve this site as I go.

I am using this blog as a learning exercise as well as, a blog. All opinions are my own.
